# Knowledge base

This repository serves as Ocial's main knowledge base. Each of the repositories that
are a component of Ocial's system must contain their own wiki and documentation assets,
but everything that gets out of their own scope must be discussed or placed here.

Some examples of those are business rules or functional decisions, since those usually involve
backend and frontend teams working together.
